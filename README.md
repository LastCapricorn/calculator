# Calculator

## The final project of The Odin Projects - Foundations Course

If there is one thing in which computers are absolute professionals, it's math.

Isn't it funny to teach them basic arithmetic?

I also did some work on this project while I was on vacation.

### So here are some desired bugs

- CE: the current input(line) will be deleted.

If it is the first line(first operand) a following operator also will disappear.

- &larr; : the last sign will be deleted, can be repeated.

If there's a result displayed, the result will be deleted.

Used after an operator in several operations also the result will be deleted!

- % : If there's only one operator you'll get the hundredth of it.

Two operands, (a, b) with operators (\*|/) result in b% of a,
two operands, (a, b) with operators (\+|\-) result in a \+|\- b% of a,

e.g.: 125 /\* 5% -> 6.25

or 125 \- 5% -> 118.75

- &radic; : with first operand gives the corresponding result
     with both operands, the given operation will be executed and then the square root of the result will be displayed.

- x&sup2; : same as square root.

- = : immediately after an operator, takes the first operand also as second operand and provides the result.

Repeatedly used, the result of an operation is taken as first operand using the previous operator and second operand,

e.g.: 3\*= -> 9, then 27, then 81...

or 4\*5= -> 20, then 100, then 500...

Please notify me, if any features occur!

(and please pardon my English, I'm just a german guy with 'google translate')
